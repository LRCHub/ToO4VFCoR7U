[00:00.05] Bad luck to talk on these rides
[00:08.65] Mind on the road, your dilated eyes
[00:14.40] Watch the clouds float, white Ferrari
[00:20.26] Had a good time
[00:21.80] (Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?
[00:26.29] I let you out at Central
[00:38.29] 
[00:35.16] I didn't care to state the plain
[00:40.78] Kept my mouth closed
[00:42.97] We're both so familiar
[00:51.62] White Ferrari, good times
[01:04.12] 
[00:56.02] Stick by me, close by me
[00:59.97] You were fine
[01:01.56] You were fine here
[01:02.94] That's just a slow body
[01:05.86] You left when I forgot to speak
[01:09.71] So I text to speech, lesser speeds
[01:12.66] Texas speed, yes
[01:14.88] Basic takes its toll on me,
[01:17.06] Eventually, eventually, yes
[01:20.05] Ah, on me eventually, eventually, yes
[01:38.55] 
[01:25.53] I care for you still and I will forever
[01:34.44] That was my part of the deal, honest
[01:40.10] We got so familiar
[01:45.58] Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
[01:53.04] Good times
[01:57.89] In this life, life
[02:02.13] In this life, life
[02:11.13] 
[02:12.08] One too many years
[02:13.61] Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
[02:20.56] Mind over matter is magic
[02:24.35] I do magic
[02:28.56] If you think about it it'll be over in no time
[02:32.92] And that's life
[02:40.42] 
[03:07.05] I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
[03:11.53] You say we're small and not worth the mention
[03:15.92] You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
[03:20.44] We could vacay, there's places to go
[03:24.50] Clearly this isn't all that there is
[03:28.70] Can't take what's been given
[03:31.11] But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
[03:51.11] 
[03:35.62] Primal and naked
[03:37.93] You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned
[03:42.39] It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
[03:46.68] And we're free to roam
